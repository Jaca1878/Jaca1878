 Hi 👋 I’m @Jaca1878, but my close friends call me Jacunia.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... a lot of stuff... Arduino, Raspberry, PLC, Python... Golf, DIY, Drones, RC Toys, Piano, 3D Printing...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python for the data science profession
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... something interesting I guess(?)
- 📫 How to reach me ... idk if someone will need to, so I will leave it like this, at least for now
